# Project 2
#### By Tony Daniels

## Project Summary

Im building a shopping list app  using mongo, express node and liquid. User should be able to put down what they need to buy on this app so that they donâ€™t have to worry about forgetting after. It will consist of a name property, a number property and if its been obtained already.

## Models

I will be using one model and one seed to make this project work. I might call it shoppings, items, or wishlists
 something similar. PLanning on using the name as plural so I can use the indexes or ids in singular when it comes to making the loop. Just for my better understanding early on in developing.
